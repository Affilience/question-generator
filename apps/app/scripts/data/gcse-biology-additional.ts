      introduction: `Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that can cause disease in plants and animals. Unlike bacteria, fungal cells have a nucleus and cell wall made of chitin. Many fungi are beneficial (decomposers, food production), but some cause infections that can be serious.

Rose black spot is a fungal disease affecting roses. It causes purple or black spots on leaves, which then turn yellow and drop early. The fungus spreads through water splash and wind dispersal of spores. It reduces photosynthesis, weakening the plant and reducing flower production.

Rose black spot is treated by removing and destroying affected leaves, and using fungicide sprays. Good garden hygiene and adequate plant spacing for air circulation help prevent spread. The disease is particularly problematic in wet, humid conditions.

Athlete\'s foot is a common fungal infection in humans, affecting the skin between toes. It causes itching, flaking, and cracking of skin. The fungus thrives in warm, moist conditions like swimming pools, showers, and inside sweaty shoes.

Prevention involves keeping feet clean and dry, not sharing towels, wearing flip-flops in public showers, and changing socks regularly. Treatment uses antifungal creams, sprays, or powders. More serious fungal infections can occur in people with weakened immune systems and may require oral antifungal medication.`

      introduction: `Protists are eukaryotic microorganisms, many of which are single-celled. While most protists are harmless, some cause serious diseases. The most significant protist disease studied at GCSE is malaria, which kills hundreds of thousands of people annually.

Malaria is caused by Plasmodium, a parasitic protist. It is not spread directly between humans but requires a vector - the female Anopheles mosquito. When an infected mosquito bites a human, it injects Plasmodium parasites into the blood. The parasites travel to the liver and then infect red blood cells.

Symptoms of malaria include recurrent episodes of fever, shaking, and sweating, often occurring every 48-72 hours as parasites burst from red blood cells. Severe cases can cause anaemia (from destroyed red blood cells), organ failure, and death, particularly in young children.

Prevention of malaria focuses on avoiding mosquito bites and reducing mosquito populations. Methods include sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets, using insect repellent, draining stagnant water where mosquitoes breed, and taking antimalarial drugs when visiting affected areas.

There is ongoing research into malaria vaccines and new treatments. The disease mainly affects tropical and subtropical regions where the mosquito vector lives. Climate change may expand the range of malaria-carrying mosquitoes in future.`

      introduction: `Plants can be infected by a range of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protists. They can also suffer from mineral deficiencies that cause disease-like symptoms. Recognising plant diseases is important for agriculture and horticulture.

Common signs of plant disease include: stunted growth, spots on leaves, areas of decay or rot, growths (galls), malformed stems and leaves, discolouration, and the presence of pests. Different pathogens cause characteristic symptoms that can help identify the disease.

Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) causes a distinctive mosaic pattern of light and dark green on leaves. It reduces photosynthesis by destroying chloroplasts, leading to reduced growth. It spreads through direct contact between plants and on contaminated tools.

Mineral deficiency diseases occur when plants lack essential nutrients. Nitrogen deficiency causes yellowing of older leaves and stunted growth. Magnesium deficiency causes chlorosis (yellowing between leaf veins) as magnesium is needed for chlorophyll production.

Plants can be identified as diseased by visual inspection, using laboratory tests (growing microorganisms from samples, DNA analysis), or testing for mineral deficiencies. Early detection is important for treatment and preventing spread to other plants.`

      introduction: `The brain is the control centre of the nervous system, coordinating responses and processing information. It contains billions of neurons connected in complex networks. Different regions of the brain have specialised functions.

The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the brain, responsible for consciousness, intelligence, memory, language, and processing sensory information. It is divided into two hemispheres, each controlling the opposite side of the body.

The cerebellum is located at the back of the brain beneath the cerebrum. It coordinates muscle activity, maintaining balance and precise movement. Damage to the cerebellum causes problems with coordination and balance.

The medulla oblongata is at the base of the brain, connecting to the spinal cord. It controls unconscious activities like breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. These are vital functions that continue without conscious thought.

Studying the brain is challenging because it is complex and cannot be easily experimented on in living humans. Scientists use brain scans (MRI, CT, PET), study effects of brain damage, use electrical stimulation during surgery, and research on animals. Our understanding is still developing.`

      meta_description: 'Learn about treating kidney failure with dialysis and transplants, including how dialysis works for GCSE Biology.',
      introduction: `When kidneys fail, waste products and excess water build up in the blood, which can be fatal. Kidney failure can be treated by dialysis (an artificial method of filtering blood) or by kidney transplant (replacing the failed kidney with a healthy one from a donor).

Dialysis uses a machine to filter waste from the blood. In haemodialysis, blood is pumped through a machine containing a partially permeable membrane. The blood flows on one side, dialysis fluid on the other. Urea and excess salts diffuse from blood into the fluid; useful substances remain.

The dialysis fluid is carefully designed. It contains normal levels of glucose and salts, so these don\'t diffuse out of the blood. It contains no urea, creating a concentration gradient for urea to diffuse out. The fluid flows in the opposite direction to blood (countercurrent) for maximum efficiency.

Dialysis must be performed regularly - typically three times per week for several hours. It maintains life but is time-consuming and requires strict dietary control. Patients must limit fluid, salt, and protein intake between treatments.

Kidney transplants replace the failed kidney with a healthy donor kidney. This offers a better quality of life as the transplanted kidney can regulate the body continuously. However, transplants require matching donors (tissue type matching reduces rejection) and lifelong immunosuppressant drugs to prevent the immune system attacking the foreign organ.`

      introduction: `Human reproduction involves the interaction of male and female reproductive systems, controlled by hormones. Understanding these processes is essential for GCSE Biology, including the menstrual cycle and pregnancy.

The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones from the pituitary gland and ovaries. FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) from the pituitary causes eggs to mature in the ovaries and stimulates oestrogen production. Oestrogen from the ovaries causes the uterus lining to thicken and stimulates LH release.

LH (luteinising hormone) surge causes ovulation - release of an egg from the ovary around day 14. After ovulation, the follicle becomes the corpus luteum and produces progesterone, which maintains the thick uterus lining. If no pregnancy occurs, progesterone levels fall and the lining breaks down (menstruation).

During pregnancy, the embryo produces hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin), which maintains the corpus luteum. This keeps progesterone levels high, maintaining the uterus lining. Pregnancy tests detect hCG in urine.

Hormones interact through feedback mechanisms. Oestrogen inhibits FSH release (negative feedback) but at high levels triggers LH release (positive feedback for ovulation). After ovulation, progesterone inhibits FSH and LH, preventing further ovulation during that cycle.`

Hormonal contraception includes the combined pill (oestrogen and progesterone), which inhibits FSH to prevent egg maturation and ovulation. The progesterone-only pill works mainly by thickening cervical mucus to prevent sperm reaching the egg. Both are over 99% effective when used correctly.

Other hormonal methods include contraceptive implants (small rods releasing progesterone, lasting 3 years), injections (lasting 2-3 months), hormonal IUS (coil releasing progesterone, lasting 3-5 years), and patches. These all prevent ovulation and/or create conditions hostile to sperm.

Non-hormonal methods include condoms (barrier preventing sperm reaching egg, also protect against STIs), diaphragms (barrier over cervix used with spermicide), copper IUD (coil that releases copper, toxic to sperm), and surgical sterilisation.

Natural methods include fertility awareness (avoiding intercourse during fertile period) and abstinence. These don\'t use drugs or devices but are less reliable as they depend on accurate cycle prediction and self-control.`

It helps couples who cannot conceive naturally due to blocked fallopian tubes, low sperm count, or unexplained infertility.

The IVF process begins with hormone treatment. FSH and LH are given to stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple eggs (superovulation). Normally only one egg matures per cycle, but IVF aims to collect several eggs to increase success chances.

Mature eggs are collected from the ovaries using a needle guided by ultrasound. Sperm from the partner or a donor is prepared. Eggs and sperm are mixed in a dish for fertilisation to occur. The fertilised eggs (embryos) are incubated for a few days.

One or two healthy embryos are selected and transferred to the uterus using a thin tube. Extra embryos can be frozen for future attempts if needed. Success rates vary - typically 20-35% per cycle depending on age and other factors.

IVF raises ethical considerations. It gives infertile couples the chance to have children, but it is expensive, emotionally demanding, and not always successful. Some people have concerns about unused embryos, multiple pregnancies from multiple embryos, and potential long-term effects.`
