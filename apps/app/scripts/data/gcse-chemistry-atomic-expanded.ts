      title: 'The Periodic Table | GCSE Chemistry',
      meta_description: 'Learn about the periodic table, groups, periods and patterns in element properties for GCSE Chemistry.',
      introduction: `The periodic table arranges elements in order of increasing atomic number. Elements in the same column (group) have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of electrons in their outer shell.

The periodic table is arranged into rows called periods and columns called groups. Groups are numbered 1-7 and 0 (or 18). The group number tells you how many electrons are in the outer shell (except for Group 0 which has full outer shells).

Metals are found on the left and centre of the periodic table. They form positive ions by losing electrons. Non-metals are found on the right side and form negative ions by gaining electrons.

The properties of elements show trends across periods and down groups. Going down a group, atoms get larger and metals become more reactive (easier to lose outer electrons). Going across a period, atomic radius decreases and reactivity patterns change.

Dmitri Mendeleev arranged elements by atomic mass and predicted properties of undiscovered elements. The modern periodic table arranges by atomic number, which fixed some of Mendeleev's ordering issues and explains why similar elements appear in groups.`

      introduction: `Group 1 elements are called alkali metals: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. They all have one electron in their outer shell, which they lose easily to form +1 ions.

Alkali metals are soft, shiny metals with low melting points and densities compared to other metals. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are less dense than water. They are stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and water.

Alkali metals react vigorously with water to produce hydrogen gas and an alkaline hydroxide solution: 2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂. The reactivity increases down the group as the outer electron is further from the nucleus and easier to lose.

With water: lithium fizzes gently, sodium fizzes vigorously and may melt into a ball, potassium fizzes violently and the hydrogen produced catches fire with a lilac flame. Rubidium and caesium react explosively.

Alkali metals also react with chlorine to form white ionic chlorides: 2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl. The compounds formed are typical ionic compounds - they dissolve in water and conduct electricity when molten or in solution.`

      meta_description: 'Learn about halogens including fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, their properties and reactions for GCSE Chemistry.',
      introduction: `Group 7 elements are called halogens: fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine. They all have seven electrons in their outer shell and need to gain one electron to achieve a full outer shell, forming -1 ions (halide ions).

Halogens are non-metals that exist as diatomic molecules (F₂, Cl₂, Br₂, I₂). They show a gradual change in physical properties: fluorine is a pale yellow gas, chlorine is a green gas, bromine is a red-brown liquid, iodine is a grey solid that sublimes to purple vapour.

Reactivity decreases down the group because atoms get larger. The outer shell is further from the nucleus, making it harder to attract an extra electron. Fluorine is the most reactive halogen.

Halogens react with metals to form ionic halides: 2Fe + 3Cl₂ → 2FeCl₃. They react with hydrogen to form hydrogen halides: H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl.

A more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive halogen from a solution of its salt. Chlorine displaces bromine: Cl₂ + 2KBr → 2KCl + Br₂. This is because chlorine gains electrons more readily than bromine.`

      meta_description: 'Learn about noble gases including helium, neon and argon, why they are unreactive for GCSE Chemistry.',
      introduction: `Group 0 (or Group 8/18) contains the noble gases: helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon. They are colourless gases that exist as single atoms (monatomic) rather than molecules.

Noble gases are extremely unreactive because they have full outer electron shells. Helium has 2 electrons filling its first shell; the others have 8 electrons in their outer shell. This stable arrangement means they don't need to gain, lose, or share electrons.

Boiling points increase down the group as the atoms get larger. Larger atoms have more electrons, creating stronger intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces). Helium has the lowest boiling point of any element (-269°C).

Uses of noble gases exploit their unreactivity: helium in balloons and airships (light and non-flammable), neon in advertising signs (glows orange-red when electricity passes through), argon in light bulbs (provides inert atmosphere preventing filament burning).

Although called 'inert gases' historically, some noble gases can form compounds under extreme conditions. However, for GCSE purposes, they are considered completely unreactive.`

      meta_description: 'Learn about transition metals, their properties, ions and uses for GCSE Chemistry examination success.',
      introduction: `The transition metals are found in the central block of the periodic table between Groups 2 and 3. Common examples include iron, copper, nickel, chromium, zinc, and titanium.

Transition metals are typical metals: hard, dense, strong, shiny, and good conductors of heat and electricity. They have much higher melting points than Group 1 metals. Iron melts at 1538°C compared to sodium at 98°C.

Unlike Group 1 metals, transition metals can form ions with different charges. Iron can be Fe²⁺ or Fe³⁺, copper can be Cu⁺ or Cu²⁺. This is shown in compound names using Roman numerals: iron(II) chloride (FeCl₂) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl₃).

Transition metals and their compounds often act as catalysts. Iron is used in the Haber process, vanadium(V) oxide in the Contact process, and nickel in hydrogenation of oils.

Many transition metal compounds are coloured. Copper compounds are often blue or green, iron(II) compounds are green, iron(III) compounds are orange-brown. This is why transition metals are used in pigments and dyes.`

      meta_description: 'Learn how our understanding of atoms has developed from Dalton to the nuclear model for GCSE Chemistry.',
      introduction: `Our understanding of atomic structure has evolved over centuries. Each new discovery led to modifications of the atomic model to explain new observations.

John Dalton (early 1800s) proposed that atoms were solid spheres that could not be divided. Different elements had different atoms. This explained the laws of chemical combination but couldn't explain electrical phenomena.

J.J. Thomson (1897) discovered electrons using cathode ray tubes. He proposed the "plum pudding" model where electrons were embedded in a sphere of positive charge, like currants in a pudding.

Ernest Rutherford (1911) fired alpha particles at gold foil. Most passed through, but some bounced back. This showed atoms were mostly empty space with a tiny, dense, positive nucleus. Electrons orbited the nucleus at a distance.

Niels Bohr (1913) modified the model to explain why electrons didn't spiral into the nucleus. He proposed electrons orbit in fixed shells (energy levels) at specific distances. Electrons can move between shells by absorbing or emitting energy.

James Chadwick (1932) discovered neutrons in the nucleus. The modern model has protons and neutrons in a nucleus, with electrons in shells around it.`
