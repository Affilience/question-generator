# AQA GCSE Mathematics: Topic-Specific Question Structures

This document provides structural frameworks for each topic area. These are NOT templates to fill in—they are structural principles that should inform original question design.

## Number

### Fractions

**Structural types:**

1. **Operation questions**
   - Structure: [Mixed/improper] [operation] [mixed/improper]
   - Cognitive demand: Converting between forms → performing operation → simplifying → converting result
   - Mark driver: Number of conversions/stages required

2. **Comparison questions**
   - Structure: Compare two quantities that require fraction calculation to resolve
   - Cognitive demand: Calculate each → compare → conclude
   - Mark driver: Complexity of initial calculations

3. **Fraction of amount (contextual)**
   - Structure: Total amount → fraction relationship → find unknown
   - Can be forward (find the fraction) or reverse (given fraction result, find total)
   - Mark driver: Direction of reasoning + number of steps

**Mark allocation principles:**
- Converting form: 1 mark if isolated, absorbed into method mark if part of larger calculation
- Each operation: 1 method mark
- Final simplification: Usually part of accuracy mark
- "Give as mixed number": Accuracy mark requires correct form

## Problem Solving Structures

## Summary

These structures are PRINCIPLES, not templates. Original questions emerge from:
- Understanding WHY questions are structured certain ways
- Combining structural elements in fresh configurations
- Letting mathematical content drive structure (not vice versa)
- Ensuring mark allocation reflects genuine cognitive demand

Every question should feel like a natural mathematical task that happens to test specific skills—not an artificial construct designed to fit a template.
