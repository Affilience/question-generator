## Paper 2: Pure Mathematics and Mechanics

Paper 2 is divided into two sections:
- **Section A**: Pure Mathematics (~50 marks)
- **Section B**: Mechanics (~50 marks)

### Section A: Pure Mathematics Topics

The pure mathematics in Paper 2 covers the same topics as Paper 1 but often with different emphasis:
- Functions and graphs (including sketching transformations)
- Coordinate geometry (parametric curves, tangent/normal)
- Calculus (differentiation, integration, areas)
- Trigonometry (identities, equations)
- Exponentials and logarithms
- Sequences and series

### Section B: Mechanics Topics

#### 1. Kinematics
- Displacement, velocity, acceleration relationships
- Constant acceleration (SUVAT equations): $v = u + at$, $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$, $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$
- Variable acceleration using calculus: $v = \frac{ds}{dt}$, $a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$
- Integration to find velocity from acceleration, displacement from velocity
- Interpreting velocity-time and displacement-time graphs
- Motion in 2D using vectors

#### 2. Forces and Newton's Laws
- Newton's three laws of motion
- Weight: $W = mg$ (use $g = 9.8$ m s⁻² unless stated)
- Normal reaction force
- Friction: $F \leq \mu R$ (limiting friction $F = \mu R$)
- Tension in strings/ropes
- Resolving forces into components
- Equilibrium conditions: $\sum F = 0$
- $F = ma$ for accelerating systems
- Connected particles (e.g., particles on tables connected by strings over pulleys)

#### 3. Moments
- Moment = Force × Perpendicular distance from pivot
- Clockwise and anticlockwise moments
- Equilibrium: sum of clockwise moments = sum of anticlockwise moments
- Uniform rods and beams (weight acts at centre)
- Non-uniform rods (centre of mass specified)
- Tilting and toppling problems

#### 4. Vectors in Mechanics
- Position vectors: $\mathbf{r} = x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j}$
- Velocity vectors: $\mathbf{v} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}$
- Acceleration vectors: $\mathbf{a} = \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}$
- Unit vectors $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$ (and $\mathbf{k}$ for 3D)
- Magnitude of vectors: $|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$
- Direction/bearing from vector components

#### 5. Projectiles
- Motion under gravity (horizontal and vertical components independent)
- Horizontal: constant velocity, $x = ut\cos\theta$
- Vertical: constant acceleration $g$, $y = ut\sin\theta - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$
- Time of flight, range, maximum height
- Trajectory equation: $y = x\tan\theta - \frac{gx^2}{2u^2\cos^2\theta}$
- Projectiles from elevated positions

#### 6. Connected Particles and Pulleys
- Particles connected by inextensible strings
- Smooth and rough pulleys
- Atwood machines
- Particles on inclined planes
- Systems with multiple masses

### Mechanics Modelling Assumptions

Questions often state or imply these assumptions:
- **"Particle"**: Object with mass but negligible size (no rotation)
- **"Light"**: Negligible mass (for strings, pulleys, rods)
- **"Inextensible"**: String doesn't stretch (same acceleration for connected particles)
- **"Smooth"**: No friction
- **"Rough"**: Friction present (coefficient $\mu$ may be given)
- **"Uniform"**: Mass evenly distributed (weight acts at geometric centre)
- **Air resistance neglected**: Only gravity acts on projectiles

### Mechanics Question Patterns

| Question Type | Typical Marks | Common Tasks |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Kinematics SUVAT | 3-5 | Find time, distance, or velocity |
| Variable acceleration | 4-6 | Integrate/differentiate, find maximum |

3. **Identify test type**: One-tailed or two-tailed
4. **Calculate test statistic or probability**
5. **Compare with critical value or significance level**
6. **State conclusion**: In terms of $H_0$ (reject/do not reject)
7. **Interpret in context**: What this means for the scenario

## Question Construction Principles

### Multiple Choice Questions (Q1-4)
- Test a single concept or quick calculation
- Four options: one correct, three plausible distractors
- Distractors should represent common errors:
  - Sign errors
  - Coefficient errors
  - Reversed operations
  - Partial completion
- No working space provided
- Two format variants used:
  - **"Circle your answer."** — Options displayed horizontally
  - **"Tick (✓) one box."** — Options displayed vertically with tick boxes

**Example Patterns:**

*Circle format:*
```
Given that y = 2x³, find dy/dx

Circle your answer.
[1 mark]

dy/dx = 5x²     dy/dx = 6x²     dy/dx = x⁴/2     dy/dx = 6x³
```

*Tick box format:*
```
Which of the following is a counter-example to the statement
"n² − n + 11 is a prime number for all positive integer values of n"?

Tick (✓) one box.
[1 mark]

n = 5   [ ]
n = 9   [ ]
n = 10  [ ]
n = 11  [ ]
```

### Short Answer Questions (Q5-8)
- Single concept with method required
- Clear progression from setup to answer
- "Show that" questions provide the answer to prove
- 3-6 marks typically

**Example Patterns:**
- Trapezium rule with given table of values [3-4 marks]
- Prove a logarithmic equation has exactly one solution [5 marks]
- Integration by parts to show a given result [6 marks]
- Surd manipulation to show rationality [3-4 marks]

### Multi-Part Questions (Q9-16)
- Unified context or mathematical theme
- Parts build on each other but often allow independent access
- Mix of "calculate," "show that," and "hence" parts
- Sub-numbering: (a), (b), (c) with (i), (ii) for sub-parts

**Structure Pattern:**
```
9   [Context or setup]

9(a)(i)   Simple calculation or setup [1-2 marks]
9(a)(ii)  Build on (i), more complex [3-4 marks]
9(b)(i)   New aspect using earlier results [3-4 marks]
9(b)(ii)  Interpretation or extension [1-2 marks]
```

## Modelling Questions at A-Level

A-Level frequently includes real-world modelling scenarios:

### Common Contexts
- **Motion and mechanics**: Theme park rides, moving objects, projectiles
- **Growth and decay**: Population, radioactive decay, temperature, pollution
- **Rates of change**: Filling/emptying containers, spread of disease
- **Optimization**: Maximum profit, minimum cost, efficient design
- **Design and engineering**: Product design using parametric curves (e.g., surfboard cross-section shape)
- **Scientific relationships**: Logarithmic models for physical data (e.g., planetary orbital periods vs distance)
- **Sports and performance**: Athletic performance modelling (e.g., Olympic sprinter velocity profiles)

### Modelling Question Structure
1. Set up the mathematical model from context
2. Solve using appropriate technique
3. Interpret results in context
4. Evaluate limitations of model (sometimes)

**Example (from June 2023):**
```
A theme park ride has a room where floor and ceiling move.
At time t seconds: f = 1 - cos t (floor height)
                   c = 8 - 4 sin t (ceiling height)

(a) Show initial distance is 8 metres [1 mark]
(b) Show distance d = 7 + R cos(t + α) [5 marks]
(c) Find minimum distance [2 marks]
```

---

## Mark Scheme Conventions

### Mark Types
- **M marks** (Method): Correct approach, even with arithmetic errors
- **A marks** (Accuracy): Correct answer, dependent on M marks
- **B marks** (Independent): Specific correct values, not dependent on method

### Special Notations
- **ft** (follow through): Credit given for correct method on incorrect earlier values
- **dep** (dependent): Mark requires previous mark(s) to have been earned
- **oe** (or equivalent): Alternative correct forms accepted
- **awrt** (answers which round to): Accept rounded values
- **isw** (ignore subsequent working): Don't penalise extra unnecessary work

### "Show That" Marking
- Working must be SHOWN, not just verified by substitution
- All key steps must be visible
- Cannot work backwards from the given answer
- Arithmetic errors in method still earn M marks

## Notes for Question Generation

1. **Originality**: Generate fresh scenarios and numbers, not copies of past papers
2. **Authenticity**: Questions should feel like genuine exam questions
3. **Progression**: Mark allocation should match cognitive demand
4. **Completeness**: Include full mark scheme with M/A/B marks
5. **Context**: Modelling questions need realistic, engaging scenarios
6. **Precision**: Command words must be used correctly
7. **Accessibility**: Even hard questions should have accessible entry points
