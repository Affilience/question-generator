### Question Phrasing Patterns

**Single-step questions (1 mark):**
- "Work out (-4) × (-3)"
- "Write 3⅖ as an improper fraction"
- "Which number in the list is a multiple of 7?"

**Two-step questions (2 marks):**
- "Write 18 out of 30 as a fraction in its simplest form"
- "A shirt normally costs £40. In a sale there is 25% off. Work out the sale price."

**Multi-step questions (3-4 marks):**
- "Work out 2⅓ ÷ 4/5. Give your answer as a mixed number."
- Context-based problems requiring setup + calculation + answer

**Extended problems (5+ marks):**
- Multi-part questions with scaffolding (a), (b), (c)
- "Show that" proofs
- Problems combining multiple topic areas

### Answer Format Instructions
Questions often specify the required answer format:
- "Give your answer in its simplest form"

## Mark Scheme Structure

### Mark Types

**M marks (Method marks)**
- Awarded for correct mathematical approach
- Can be earned even if arithmetic is wrong
- Example: "M1 for 480 × 0.85 or 480 × 0.15"

**A marks (Accuracy marks)**
- Awarded for correct answer following correct method
- Dependent on earning the method mark
- Example: "A1 for £408"

**B marks (Independent marks)**
- Awarded for correct value/statement regardless of method
- Not dependent on other marks
- Example: "B1 for 52°"

### Mark Scheme Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| oe | "or equivalent" - accept equivalent forms |
| ft | "follow through" - mark based on their previous (possibly wrong) answer |
| dep | "dependent" - requires previous mark to be earned |
| SC | "special case" - partial credit for common errors with some merit |
| cao | "correct answer only" - no follow through allowed |
| isw | "ignore subsequent working" - ignore extra work after correct answer |

### How Marks Are Allocated

**1-mark questions:**
- B1 for correct answer (no method needed)
- Example: "B1 for 12" (single calculation)

**2-mark questions:**
- M1 A1 pattern (method then accuracy)
- Example:
  - M1 for correct method setup
  - A1 for correct final answer

**3-mark questions:**
- M1 M1 A1 or M1 A1 A1 patterns
- Each step of multi-step problems earns marks
- Example:
  - M1 for first operation
  - M1 for second operation
  - A1 for correct final answer

**4-5 mark questions:**
- Multiple method and accuracy marks
- Often include reasoning marks
- Example (geometry with reasons):
  - B1 for correct angle value
  - B1 for stating correct theorem/reason

### Follow Through (ft) Rules
When a student makes an error but continues with correct method:
- They can earn subsequent method marks
- They can earn accuracy marks if their answer is correct for their wrong value
- Example: If they got step 1 wrong (£50 instead of £60), but correctly calculate 15% of their £50, they get ft marks

### Special Case (SC) Marks
Awarded for partially correct approaches:
- SC1 might be given for a correct but unsimplified answer
- SC marks recognize understanding even when full method isn't shown

1. Clear, unambiguous wording
2. Appropriate command word for the task
3. Mark allocation matching complexity
4. Specified answer format where relevant
5. Realistic context (when contextual)
6. "Not drawn accurately" for geometric diagrams

### A good mark scheme should have:
1. Clear mark type for each point (M/A/B)
2. Explicit "oe" where equivalent answers accepted
3. Follow-through instructions where appropriate
4. Alternative methods listed
5. Common errors noted with SC marks where warranted

---

## Advanced Mark Scheme Patterns

### Additional Guidance Sections
Mark schemes include detailed "Additional Guidance" showing:
- Exactly what earns marks and what doesn't
- Common student errors and how to handle them
- Boundary cases and exceptions

**Examples of detailed guidance:**
```
"Mark the answer line. If this is blank, mark the working"
"If values are given in one or more forms, either on the answer line or in
working with nothing on the answer line, all values must be correct"
"Do not allow unprocessed answers eg 270/6"
```

### Range Acceptance Notation
- `[a, b]` - Accept values between a and b inclusive
- `[a, b)` - Accept values a ≤ value < b
- `3.14...` - Accept answers which begin 3.14 (eg 3.14, 3.142, 3.1416)

### Alternative Methods
Complex questions show multiple valid approaches:
```
Alternative method 1 – numerical
Alternative method 2 – algebraic
Alternative method 3 – trial and improvement
```
Each method has its own M1, M1dep, A1 breakdown.

### Dependency Rules
- `M1dep` - Method mark depends on previous M1 being awarded
- `B1dep` - Independent mark depends on previous B1
- Cannot earn A marks without earning prerequisite M marks

### What Loses Marks

**Further work contradicting correct answer:**
```
"Do not ignore further working for B2
eg 13x + 22 = 35x scores B1 (not B2)
eg 13x + 22, x = 22/13 scores B1 (not B2)"
```

**Premature approximation:**
- Rounding too early loses 1 mark unless instructed otherwise

**Misread/miscopy:**
- If examiner thinks student made genuine misread, only accuracy marks (up to 2) are penalised
- Method marks can still be awarded

**Unprocessed answers:**
- `270/6` without evaluating to 45 = B0
- Must simplify unless "write down" is used

### Implied Marks
Later correct work can imply earlier marks:
```
"implied by 176" (if later value 176 is seen, implies the first method step)
"may be seen on diagram" (working shown on diagrams counts)
```

---

## Foundation Tier Question Patterns

### Multi-Part Scaffolded Questions
Foundation questions often guide students through steps:

**Example structure (5-6 marks):**
```
8(a) Complete the frequency tree. [3 marks]

```
Mark scheme: B2 for all constraints met, B1 for partial (e.g., correct sum but not all different)

```
"Complete the boxes using
 a factor of 12
 and
 a factor of 40
 [ ] × [ ] = 30"
```

```
"Complete the boxes using

```

### Matching Questions
Match expressions to simplified forms:
```
"Match each expression on the left with the simplified expression on the right.
 3a + 4a  →  7a
 3a × 3a  →  9a²
 6 × 3a   →  18a

Tick one box:
□ x is negative and y is positive
□ x is positive and y is negative
□ x is negative and y is negative

### Multi-Turn Probability (Board Games)
Complex probability involving multiple events:

```
"In a board game, a player takes turns.
On each turn, the probability of moving forward is 0.6
If a player moves forward on one turn, they move forward on the next turn with probability 0.75
Otherwise they move back.
Work out the probability that a player moves forward on exactly 2 of 3 turns." [4 marks]
```
Mark scheme requires identifying all valid paths and summing probabilities.

### Inverse Proportion with Workers
Classic "workers and time" problems:

```
"5 workers take 8 days to dig a hole.
How long would it take 4 workers to dig the same hole?" [3 marks]
```

### Cubic Graph Recognition
Identifying features of cubic functions:

```
"Here is a sketch of a cubic graph.
Circle the equation of the graph.
y = x³     y = x³ − 4x     y = 4x − x³     y = x³ + 4" [1 mark]
```
Requires matching shape (turning points, intercepts) to equation.

### Cumulative Frequency Statement Verification
Checking claims about cumulative frequency data:

```
"[Cumulative frequency graph shown]
Sunita says 'More than 75% of the students revised for more than 6 hours.'
Is Sunita correct? You must show how you decide." [2 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for reading CF at 6 hours (approximately 25) and comparing to 75% of total
- A1 for correct conclusion with evidence

### Speed-Time Graph Analysis
Questions combining graph reading with kinematics:

```
"[Speed-time graph with trapezoid shape]

Answer: 4/7 (oe fraction only, not decimal or percentage)

### Exterior Angles with Follow-up
```
"Part of a regular polygon is shown. [diagram showing exterior angle x]
(a) Assume that the polygon is an octagon. Work out the size of angle x." [2 marks]
(b) "In fact, the polygon has more sides than an octagon.
     What does this mean about the size of angle x?
     Tick one box: □ More than (a) □ Same as (a) □ Less than (a) □ Could be any" [1 mark]
```

## Detailed Mark Scheme Patterns

### Alternative Methods Structure
For complex questions, mark schemes provide multiple valid approaches:

```
Alternative method 1: Comparing cost of 24 bottles
M1: 2.5 × 0.1 or 0.25 (discount for shop X)
M1dep: (2.5 – their 0.25) × 6 or 2.25 × 6 or 13.5 (shop X total)
M1: 7 × 2 or 14 (shop Z total)
A1: X with 13.5 and 14 seen

Alternative method 2: Comparing cost per bottle
M1: discount calculation
M1dep: (2.5 – 0.25) ÷ 4 or 0.5625 (shop X per bottle)
M1: 7 ÷ 12 or 0.583... (shop Z per bottle)
A1: X with both values seen
```

### "Implied by" Statements
```
"M1 implied by 176" - seeing this value implies the method was correct
"may be embedded" - method can be shown within larger calculation
"may be seen on diagram" - working on diagrams counts
```

### Specific Additional Guidance Examples

**For probability questions:**
```
"Ignore conversion attempt to decimal, fraction or percentage (but not ratio)
after correct probability seen"
"Do not allow eg 7 in 60 or 7 out of 60 unless the correct probability seen"
"Do not allow ratio"
```

**For build-up methods:**
```
"Build-up methods must be correct or show correct method for each step"
"Build up must be fully correct method, no errors, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375, 450"
```

**For expressions:**
```
"Condone missing final bracket ie 3(4a + 5b"
"Further incorrect work after a correct response is B0
eg 3(4a + 5b) = 27ab scores B0"
```

**For vectors:**
```
"Condone any type of brackets"
"Condone missing brackets for B2 or B1 but must have two numbers in a column"
"Do not allow (4, -3) or [−3, 4]" (wrong format or reversed)
```

**For "Show that" questions:**
```
"M1 may be awarded for correct work with no answer or incorrect answer,
even if this is seen amongst multiple attempts"
"Do not allow M1 if only seen embedded in an incorrect expression"
```

### Condone vs Do Not Allow

**Condone (accept):**
- Missing final bracket: 3(4a + 5b
- Multiplication sign: 3 × n + 4
- Different variable: 3x + 4 instead of 3n + 4
- Comma as decimal point (continental notation)

**Do not allow:**
- Wrong format (coordinates instead of vector)
- "of" in percentage calculations: 40% of 93 (unless recovered)
- Ratio answers for probability questions
- Unprocessed fractions when simplification required

### Unit Handling in Answers
```
"Units may be seen in working but must be seen with the correct value"
"Do not ignore further incorrect conversion after correct answer seen
 eg 910 cm = 91 m scores M1M1A0"
```

### Matching Questions Mark Guidance
```
"Mark intention"
"Matching to more than one box on the right is choice for that match"
```
Each correct match typically earns B1.

### Always/Sometimes/Never Questions
```
"Allow any unambiguous indication
 eg if a cross is the only indication in a row, take that as the answer"
"A row with a tick and some crosses, mark the tick"
"A row with more than one tick is B0 for that row"
```

### Constraint Satisfaction Questions
For questions asking for values satisfying multiple conditions:
- B2 for satisfying all criteria
- B1 for satisfying only two criteria
- SC marks may be available for specific common errors

### Reasoning Questions Guidance
```
"Ignore irrelevant reasons alongside a correct reason, unless contradictory"
```
Detailed examples of acceptable and unacceptable responses are provided, showing exactly what language earns or loses marks.

## Additional Higher Tier Patterns (Paper 3)

### Composite Function Questions
Multi-part questions testing function notation and composition:

**Part (a) - Show that:**
```
"f(x) = x² + 6x
g(x) = 2x + 4
Show that fg(x) = 4x² + 28x + 40" [3 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for (2x + 4)² + 6(2x + 4)
- M1dep for fully expanded expression (allow one error)
- A1 for correct simplification to given form

**Part (b) - Solve:**
```
"Solve fg(x) = –5" [3 marks]
```
Mark scheme requires setting up quadratic and solving by factoring, completing square, or formula.

### Algebraic Proof - Square Number Result
```
"Two integers have a difference of 6
The integers are multiplied together.
9 is then added.
Prove algebraically that the result is always a square number." [3 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for creating product (x + a)(x + b) where |a - b| = 6, eg x(x + 6)
- M1dep for expanding and adding 9: x² + 6x + 9
- A1 for factorising to (x + 3)²

### Direct Proportion with Ratio Output
```
"G is directly proportional to the square root of H.
G : H = 3 : 2 when H = 16
Work out G : H when H = 100" [4 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for G = k√H or using ratio to find relationship
- M1dep for finding k = 6 (from 16 ÷ 2 × 3 = k√16)
- M1dep for calculating G when H = 100 (6 × √100 = 60)
- A1 for ratio 60 : 100 or simplified 3 : 5

### Inverse Proportion Verification
```
"Sunil thinks that E and D are linked by the equation E = 36/D
[Graph shown]
Choose one point on the graph and state if Sunil's equation is correct for that point." [1 mark]
```
Requires substituting a coordinate pair and checking if equation holds.

### 3D Shapes from Elevations
```
"A solid shape is made from centimetre cubes.
The front elevation and side elevation of the shape are shown.
[Diagrams with dimensions]
Work out
the maximum possible number of cubes in the shape
and
the minimum possible number of cubes in the shape." [3 marks]
```
Mark scheme involves calculating cross-sectional areas and multiplying by depth.

### Complex Journey Problems
```
"Charlie is driving 293 miles home.
He
• leaves at 9.00 am
• travels the first 176 miles at an average speed of 48 mph
• drives the rest of the way at an average speed of 65 mph
Will he be home by 2.30 pm?
You must show your working." [4 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for 176 ÷ 48 (= 3.66... or 3h 40min)
- M1 for 117 ÷ 65 (= 1.8 or 1h 48min)
- M1dep for adding times
- A1 for comparison in comparable format and correct conclusion

### Reverse Percentage with Multiple Rates
```
"Kiran paid Income Tax and National Insurance on her annual salary.
[Income Tax: 0% of first £12570, 20% of rest]
[National Insurance: 0% of first £9880, 13.25% of rest]
Kiran paid £5186 Income Tax.
How much National Insurance did she pay?" [4 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for reversing percentage: 5186 ÷ 0.2 = 25930 (taxable income)
- A1 for 38500 (total salary = 25930 + 12570)
- M1 for NI calculation: (38500 – 9880) × 0.1325
- A1ft for 3792(.15)

### Estimation with Over/Under Reasoning
```
"(a) Millie is estimating 1/((³√8.34)² × 10.21)
She rounds each decimal number to 1 significant figure.
Work out Millie's estimate." [2 marks]

"(b) Millie says, 'My estimate must be more than the exact value.'
Without working out the exact value, give a reason how she can know this." [1 mark]
```
Part (b) reasoning: Both numbers rounded down → denominator smaller → fraction larger.

### Relative Frequency Reasoning
```
"(a) Ali, Ben and Cary want to know the probability of spinning red on the biased spinner.
[Ali: spun red most times; Ben: spun spinner most times; Cary: relative frequency 0.25]
Who had the best estimate? Give a reason." [1 mark]
```
Answer: Ben - more trials gives better estimate.

```
"(b) Dev spins the spinner 80 times. He says, 'My relative frequency of red is 0.185'
Give a reason why his relative frequency must be wrong." [1 mark]
```
Answer: 0.185 × 80 = 14.8 which is not a whole number.

### Histogram to Box Plot
```
"(a) [Histogram shown] How many runners did not complete the marathon?" [3 marks]
"(b) [Table with summary statistics] Draw a box plot to represent the information." [3 marks]
```
Part (a): Calculate frequencies from frequency density × class width, sum and subtract from total.
Part (b): Box plot marking - B1 for whiskers at min/max, B1 for LQ and median, B1ft for UQ.

### Trigonometry with Explicit Method Requirement
```
"Use trigonometry to work out the value of x." [3 marks]
```
Mark scheme explicitly states: "Do not accept scale drawing"

### Transformation Description (Negative Enlargement)
```
"Shape A and shape B are shown on the grid.
Describe the single transformation that maps shape A to shape B." [3 marks]
```
Answer: Enlargement, scale factor –½, centre (7, 4)
- B1 for "Enlargement"
- B1 for scale factor –½
- B1 for centre (7, 4)

Note: "Do not accept reduces, gets smaller, shrinks or negative enlargement"

### Cosine Rule and Bearings
**Part (a) - Show that with cosine rule:**
```
"Show that the distance the boat sails from C to A is 79 km to the nearest km" [2 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for 35² + 65² – 2 × 35 × 65 × cos 100
- A1 for √6240.09... = 78.9(...)

**Part (b) - Bearing calculation:**
```
"Work out the bearing of A from C." [4 marks]
```
Mark scheme shows multiple methods (sine rule or cosine rule to find angle, then calculate bearing).

---

## Mark Scheme Additional Patterns

### Alternative Methods in Mark Schemes
Complex questions list multiple valid approaches:
- Ratio problems: may show 3-4 different methods
- Journey problems: times can be shown in hours, minutes, or decimal hours
- Trigonometry: sine rule vs cosine rule approaches

### Special Case Marks for Common Errors
```
"SC2 (x =) [–1.63, –1.629] and (x =) [–5.371, –5.37]"
```
Awarded when student makes systematic error (like using wrong constant) but follows correct process.

### Implied Marks from Intermediate Values
```
"implied by 12 40 pm" (for time calculation)
"implied by volumes of 864 and 72" (for 3D problem)
"k = 6 implies M2 unless from incorrect working"
```

### Detailed Reasoning Guidance
For questions requiring explanations, mark schemes list:
- Multiple acceptable responses
- Multiple unacceptable responses
- Guidance on contradictory statements

**Example from Q11(b) - estimation reasoning:**
Acceptable:
- "Both numbers have been rounded down"
- "The denominator is smaller"
- "Because 8.34 is more than 8 and 10.21 is more than 10"

Unacceptable:
- "Because she rounded each number to one significant figure"
- "Because it rounds up"
- "Rounded up when estimating"

### Follow Through with Conditions
```
"ft their 38500, which must be > 9880"
"ft 360 – 100 – their ACB with M2 scored"
```
Follow through marks have conditions that must be met.

## Additional Question Types (2022 Papers)

### Construct Data Set from Statistics
Questions asking students to create a data set satisfying given statistical properties:

```
"For a set of five numbers,
 the mode is 8
 the median is 12
Work out one possible set of five numbers." [2 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- B2 for five numbers with mode 8 AND median 12 (eg 8, 8, 12, 16, 25)
- B1 for five numbers with mode 8 only OR median 12 only
- B1 can also be awarded for 4 or 6+ numbers if both criteria met

### Venn Diagram Criticism Questions
Given an incorrect Venn diagram, identify errors:

```
"Joel draws this Venn diagram to represent the information.
Make two criticisms of his diagram." [2 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- B1 for valid criticism about missing labels (eg "the circles should be labelled")
- B1 for valid criticism about numbers not adding correctly (eg "48 should be 47")
- Accept: "Didn't label the diagram", "The total is wrong"
- Do not accept: "It doesn't add up" (too vague), "The numbers are wrong" (too vague)

### Fill in Boxes for Products
Questions requiring students to find factor pairs:

```
"In each box, write a fraction less than 1 to make a correct calculation.
 □ × □ = 3/10" [1 mark]
```
B1 for any valid pair (eg 3/5 and 1/2, or 6/10 and 5/10)

```
"In each box, write a decimal less than 1 to make a correct calculation.
 □ × □ = 0.06" [1 mark]
```
B1 for any valid pair (eg 0.3 and 0.2, or 0.6 and 0.1)

### Term-to-Term Rule Questions (Extended)

**Working backwards from later term:**
```
"The term-to-term rule for a sequence is 'multiply by 2'
The 3rd term of the sequence is 46
Work out the 1st term. Give your answer as a decimal." [3 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for 46 ÷ 2 or 23 or 4x = 46
- M1dep for their 23 ÷ 2 or 46 ÷ 4
- A1 for 11.5
- SC2 for 5.75 or "11 remainder 1"

**Finding unknown constant:**
```
"The term-to-term rule is 'subtract k'
The 1st term is 34
The 4th term is 10
Work out the value of k." [3 marks]
```
Mark scheme shows three alternative methods:
- Alt 1: 34 - k approach (34 - 10 = 24, 3k = 24)
- Alt 2: 10 + k approach (10 + 3k = 34)
- Alt 3: Trial and improvement (testing different values of k)
- SC2 for all terms seen: 34, 26, 18, 10

### Graph Reading for Ratio
Extract information from piecewise linear graphs to find ratios:

```
"In a week, Samir is paid
• a basic hourly rate for the first 30 hours worked
• an overtime hourly rate for any extra hours worked.
[Graph shown]
Work out the ratio basic hourly rate : overtime hourly rate
Give your answer in its simplest form." [3 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for finding rate from either section (eg 450 ÷ 30 = 15 or 250 ÷ 10 = 25)
- A1 for both rates 15 and 25
- B1ft for fully simplified ratio 3:5
- Allow ±½ square tolerance for graph readings

### Circle Sector Area Comparison
Compare areas of fractional circles:

```
"P is 3/4 of a circle, radius 20cm
Q is 1/3 of a circle, radius 15cm
How many times bigger is the area of P than the area of Q?
You must show your working." [4 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for 20² × π or 15² × π
- M1dep for 3/4 × 400π = 300π OR 1/3 × 225π = 75π
- M1dep for BOTH 300π and 75π calculated
- A1 for 4 (accept P = 4Q)
- SC2 for using circumference (perimeter) instead: 40π, 30π, 10π → answer 3

---

## Additional Mark Scheme Patterns (2022 Papers)

### Embedded Answer Penalty
When the correct answer appears only within working (not on answer line):
```
"Embedded answer of 9" → M1M1A0 (loses final accuracy mark)
"Embedded answer 6 eg (2×6)/15 = 4/5" → M1A0
```

### Poor Notation Condoned
Mark schemes explicitly condone mathematically incorrect but understandable notation:
```
"Condone 22 - 4 ÷ 2 = 9" → M1M1A1 (BIDMAS violation but clear intent)
"Condone 60 ÷ 2 = 30 + 4 = 34" → B2 (equals sign misuse but clear working)
```

### Vector Notation Strictness
For translation vector questions:
```
Answer: (7, -2) as column vector
B2 for correct column vector
B1 for one component correct in vector form
SC1 for "7 right 2 down" or coordinate format (7, -2)
B0 for row vector or reversed components
```
- Must be in column vector format for full marks
- Coordinates (7, -2) or descriptions only earn SC1

### Standard Form Additional Guidance
```
"B1 for 400000 oe correct answer not in standard form eg 40 × 10⁴"
"B1 for 8 × 10⁷ or 2 × 10² seen" (intermediate values)
"Do not award both marks for correct answer from incorrect working"
```

### Index Laws - Evaluation Requirements
For questions like 3¹² ÷ 3⁷:
```
B1 for 3^(12-7) or 3⁵ (single index form)
B1 for multiplication string 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3
B1 for 3ⁿ correctly evaluated where n ≥ 4 (but must be labelled)
```
- A list 3, 9, 27, 81... does NOT score unless 81 is identified as 3⁴

### Locus Construction Tolerance
For angle bisector constructions:
```
"Pair of arcs, equal radii (± 2mm)"
"centres the intersections on AB and BC"
```
- Region can score B1 even without construction arcs
- SC1 for angle bisector of different angle if correctly constructed

### Graph Tolerance Standard
```
"± ½ square tolerance" for reading coordinates from graphs
```

## Additional Mark Scheme Patterns (2022-june-83001H)

### Recurring Decimal Alternative Methods
Mark schemes for recurring decimal questions list multiple valid approaches:
```
Alternative method 1 – convert separately
M1 for 68/99 and 45/99 (converting each decimal)
A1 for 23/99 (subtraction)

Alternative method 2 – recognise difference
M1 for recognising 0.68̇ − 0.45̇ = 0.23̇
A1 for converting 0.23̇ to 23/99

Alternative method 3 – algebraic subtraction
M1 for setting up 100x equations for each
M1dep for subtracting equations
A1 for 23/99

Alternative method 4 – combined algebraic
M1 for letting a = 0.68̇, 100a = 68.68̇
M1dep for a − b manipulation
A1 for 23/99
```

### Vector Sign Error Special Cases
For vector problems where students get the direction wrong:
```
"SC3 for (a =) −6i + 8j or (a =) 6i − 8j"
```
- SC marks awarded when method is correct but sign is reversed
- Typically SC3 out of 4 marks for this type of error

### Algebraic Fractions - Unnecessary Denominator Penalty
When simplifying algebraic fractions:
```
"A1 for (x − 4)/(x + 4) but loses A1 if written as (x − 4)/(1(x + 4)) or similar"
"Do not award A marks for answers with /1 denominator when not required"
```
Writing an unnecessary denominator (especially /1) loses the accuracy mark.

### Graph Transformation Tolerance
For sketching transformed graphs:
```
"B1 for correct shape passing through approximately correct points"
"Tolerance: ± ½ square for coordinates"
"Key features must be preserved (turning points, intercepts)"
```
- Allow ± ½ square for all coordinate readings
- Shape must be recognisably correct
- Turning points and intercepts should be in correct relative positions

### Polynomial Identity Partial Credit
For coefficient matching questions:
```
"SC2 for 2 of 3 correct constants (a, b, c)"
"M1 for expansion attempt even if not fully correct"
```
Partial credit structure:
- 1 correct constant: M1 only (for expansion attempt)
- 2 correct constants: SC2
- 3 correct constants: Full marks

### Exact Trig Value Usage
For questions requiring exact trigonometric values:
```
"B1 for correct surd form of each trig value used"
"Accept tan30° = 1/√3 or √3/3 (both forms)"
"Accept sin60° = √3/2 or ½√3"
"Must use exact values, not decimal approximations"
```

### Multi-Path Probability Marking
For complex probability requiring multiple event paths:
```
"M1 for identifying at least one valid path"
"M1dep for correct probability of their identified path(s)"
"A1 for all valid paths identified with correct total"
```
- Credit given for partial identification of paths
- Must sum all valid paths for full accuracy mark

---

## Additional Question Patterns (2022-june-83002F)

### Digit Product Questions
Novel question type where students multiply digits of a number:

```
"Sue is working with 2-digit numbers.
She multiplies the digits together to get an answer.
For 63, she multiplies 6 by 3 so 63 gives an answer of 18

(a) Write down a different 2-digit number that gives an answer of 18 [1 mark]
(b) Write down a 2-digit number that gives an answer of 0 [1 mark]
(c) Write down a 2-digit number that gives an answer greater than 70 [1 mark]"
```
Mark scheme:
- B1 for each valid answer
- Accept notation like "3 × 6" or "3, 6" or "3 and 6"
- "Any evaluation included in the answer must be correct"
- "Inclusion of an incorrect answer eg 36 and 24" = B0

### Error Identification Questions
Questions asking students to identify mistakes in given working:

```
"Sofia tries to work out 3 × (4 + 2)
Here is her working: 3 × (4 + 2) = 12 + 3 = 15
What mistake has she made?" [1 mark]
```
Mark scheme provides detailed acceptable/unacceptable responses:

**Acceptable:**
- "She hasn't multiplied 2 by 3"
- "3 × 2 = 6"
- "Answer is 18"
- "She should have done the brackets first"
- "She should have added 4 and 2 first"

**Unacceptable:**
- "She didn't use BODMAS / BIDMAS" (too vague)
- "She didn't expand / multiply out the brackets correctly" (too vague)
- "3 should be 2"
- "The brackets are in the wrong place"

### Ratio to Percentage Conversion
```
"The people at a party are either adults or children.
adults : children = 9 : 11
What percentage are adults?" [2 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for 9/(9+11) or 9/20 or 0.45 or 45:55
- A1 for 45
- SC1 for 55 (common error of finding children percentage)

### Percentage to Ratio in n:1 Form
```
"68% are from Spain
number from France = number from Germany
Work out number from Spain : number from France
Give your answer in the form n : 1" [3 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for (100-68)÷2 = 16
- A1 for ratio not in n:1 form (68:16 or 17:4 or 0.68:0.16)
- B1ft for converting to n:1 form (4.25:1)
- "ft values must give n to 2 dp or better"

### Show That with Number Properties
```
"Show that 2125 can be written as
a cube number multiplied by a prime number between 10 and 20" [2 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- B2 for 125 and 17 (or 5³ and 17) together
- B1 for listing at least three cube numbers (8, 27, 64, 125, 216...)
- B1 for listing all four primes 11, 13, 17, 19
- B1 for attempting (cube > 1) × (prime between 10-20)
- B1 for 2125 ÷ (cube > 1) or 2125 ÷ (prime between 10-20)

### Verification Questions with Yes/No Boxes
```
"Ellie says, 'In total, I paid more than Harry because 20% is greater than 10%'
Is she correct? Tick a box: Yes □  No □
Show calculations to support your answer." [2 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for calculating both percentage changes (80 × 0.9 or 72 AND 25 × 1.2 or 30)
- A1 for "No" with correct valid amount(s)
- "If neither box is ticked, No may be implied"

### Compound Shape with Pythagoras Prerequisite
Questions requiring students to find a missing length before calculating area:

```
"[Diagram showing right-angled triangle joined to rectangle]
Triangle: legs 30cm and 16cm
Rectangle: width 52cm
Work out the area of the shape." [5 marks]
```
Mark scheme:
- M1 for 16² and 30² (setting up Pythagoras)
- M1dep for √(256 + 900) = 34 (finding hypotenuse)
- M1dep for 52 × 34 = 1768 (rectangle area)
- M1 for ½ × 30 × 16 = 240 (triangle area)
- A1 for 2008
- SC3 for 2248 (using 30 × 16 instead of ½ × 30 × 16 for triangle)

---

## Additional Mark Scheme Patterns (2022-june-83002F)

### Rounding Answer Format
For rounding questions, trailing zeros are not accepted:
```
"Round 2.84 to 1 decimal place" [1 mark]
Answer: 2.8
"2.80" scores B0
```

### Optimization with Multiple Combinations
For questions like "smallest total amount":
```
Mark scheme shows all valid combinations:
- 2 × £18 + 1 × £10 = £46 (for 5 litres)
- 1 × £18 + 3 × £10 = £48
- 5 × £10 = £50
```
SC marks for common errors (e.g., SC1 for using 2.5 bottles at £18).

### Drawing Construction Tolerance
For construction questions:
```
"angle ABC = [88°, 92°]"
"BC = [3.8, 4.2] cm"
"DC = [5.8, 6.2] cm"
```
- Lengths of lines ≥ 1cm irrelevant for method marks
- "Condone absence of labels C and D"
- SC2 for reflection of correct shape with right angle at wrong vertex

### Unit Format Requirements
For answers requiring specific unit formats:
```
Answer: 7 kilograms 850 grams
SC2 for "7.85(0) kilograms 7850 grams" (mixed notation)
```
Embedded correct value in wrong answer still earns method marks.

### Probability Answer Format Strictness
```
"Do not allow ratio (even if correct answer also seen)"
"eg 33 : 120" scores B0
"Answer only in words eg 33 out of 120" scores B0
"Only 27.5 (without %)" scores B0
```
Must be fraction, decimal, or percentage format.

### Ratio n:1 Form Precision
```
"ft values must give n to 2 dp or better"
"Correct ratio with subsequent truncation or rounding to < 2 dp
 eg1 4.25 : 1, Answer 4 : 1" scores M1A1B0
```

### Factorisation Bracket Condoning
```
"Condone missing final bracket ie 7(3x + 4" scores B1
"Further incorrect work after a correct response is B0
 eg 7(3x + 4) = 7(7x)" scores B0
```

### Missing Value from Mean - Multiple Methods
Mark schemes show 5 alternative methods:
- Alt 1: Total = mean × count, subtract known values
- Alt 2: Trial and improvement with mean verification
- Alt 3: Find mean of known values, calculate difference
- Alt 4: Find mean of known values ÷ 5, multiply difference by 5
