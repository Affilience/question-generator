# AQA GCSE Mathematics: Question Construction Principles

This document teaches the underlying principles of how AQA constructs GCSE Mathematics questions. The goal is to enable generation of genuinely original questions that exhibit authentic AQA characteristics—not copies of past papers with different numbers, but questions that could plausibly appear on a future exam.

---

## Part 1: The Philosophy of AQA Assessment

### 1.1 What AQA Tests

AQA questions are designed to assess **mathematical proficiency** across three assessment objectives:

| AO | Description | Typical Weighting |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| AO1 | Use and apply standard techniques | 40% |
| AO2 | Reason, interpret and communicate mathematically | 30% |
| AO3 | Solve problems within mathematics and other contexts | 30% |

**Key insight:** A single question often spans multiple AOs. A "calculate the area" question (AO1) becomes AO3 when embedded in a context requiring students to determine which calculation is needed.

### 1.2 The "Accessible Yet Discriminating" Principle

Every AQA question is designed to be:
- **Accessible:** Students of target ability can make meaningful progress
- **Discriminating:** Stronger students demonstrate deeper understanding

This is achieved through:
- Entry points that allow partial credit
- Extensions that require synthesis or reasoning
- Mark schemes that reward method even when answers are wrong

### 1.3 Authenticity Over Novelty

AQA questions feel authentic because they:
- Use mathematically natural scenarios (not contrived setups)
- Present information as it would appear in real situations
- Require the same thinking processes as genuine mathematical work

Questions should never feel like puzzles designed to trick students—they should feel like genuine mathematical tasks.

## Part 2: Command Word Semantics

Command words are not interchangeable. Each carries specific implications for what students must do and how marks are allocated.

### 2.1 Calculation Commands

**"Work out"**
- Implies a calculation process
- Working MUST be shown (even if not explicitly stated)
- Method marks are available
- The journey matters as much as the destination

**"Calculate"**
- Essentially identical to "work out"
- Slightly more formal tone
- Often used in measurement/science contexts

**"Find"**
- Broader than "work out"—may involve deduction, not just calculation
- Can apply to non-numerical answers (coordinates, equations)
- Working typically expected but may not always be necessary

**"Write down"**
- NO working required or expected
- Tests recall or recognition
- Always worth exactly 1 mark
- The answer alone suffices—no partial credit possible

**"Estimate"**
- Round FIRST, then calculate with rounded values
- Using exact values then rounding is NOT estimation
- Marks typically: M1 for evidence of rounding, A1 for calculation with rounded values

### 2.2 Algebraic Commands

**"Simplify"**
- Reduce to simplest form
- "Simplify fully" means ALL possible simplification must be done
- Partially simplified answers lose marks

**"Factorise"**
- Write as a product of factors
- "Factorise fully" requires complete factorisation (including taking out common factors first if needed)
- Partial factorisation may earn partial credit

**"Expand"**
- Multiply out brackets
- "Expand and simplify" requires collecting like terms after expansion

**"Solve"**
- Find the value(s) that satisfy the equation/inequality
- ALL solutions must be given (quadratics have two, etc.)
- For inequalities, present answer in appropriate notation

**"Make x the subject"**
- Rearrange so x = [expression without x on right side]
- x may appear more than once initially—must be isolated

### 2.3 Reasoning Commands

**"Show that"**
- The answer is PROVIDED—students prove it's correct
- All logical steps must be shown
- Cannot work backwards from the given answer
- Marks awarded for the quality of mathematical argument

**"Prove"**
- More rigorous than "show that"
- Requires formal mathematical argument
- Must be generalised (not just numerical examples)
- Variables must be defined

**"Explain"**
- Give mathematical reasons
- Must use appropriate mathematical vocabulary
- "Because" statements need mathematical justification
- Marks for quality of explanation, not just correct conclusion

**"Give reasons for your answer"**
- State the mathematical principles used
- Name theorems/properties explicitly
- Generic statements ("I worked it out") score zero

**"You must show your working"**
- Explicit instruction that method marks require visible working
- Correct answer without working typically loses method marks
- Signifies question is multi-step

### 2.4 Comparison Commands

**"Which is greater/bigger/more?"**
- Requires explicit comparison of calculated values
- Must show both calculations
- Must state clear conclusion

**"Is [person] correct?"**
- Test a claim—requires evidence either way
- Must show mathematical justification
- "Yes" or "No" alone is insufficient

---

## Part 3: Mark Allocation Logic

### 3.1 The Mark-Complexity Relationship

Marks correlate with **cognitive demand**, not just steps:

| Marks | Typical Characteristics |
|-------|------------------------|
| 1 | Single recall, recognition, or one-step calculation |
| 2 | Two-step calculation OR one-step with reasoning |
| 3 | Multi-step with clear progression OR calculation + interpretation |
| 4 | Complex multi-step OR synthesis of concepts |
| 5+ | Extended problem solving, proof, or multi-part with synthesis |

**Critical insight:** A 4-mark question isn't just "four 1-mark steps"—it requires qualitatively deeper engagement.

### 3.2 What Determines Mark Count

**Increases marks:**
- Number of distinct mathematical operations required
- Need to interpret/decode information before calculating
- Requirement to set up equations from context
- Need to combine multiple concepts
- Reasoning or justification required
- Unscaffolded problem solving (choosing own method)

**Does NOT increase marks:**
- Arithmetic difficulty alone (hard numbers ≠ more marks)
- Length of question text
- Size of numbers in answer
- Whether calculator is allowed

### 3.3 Foundation vs Higher Mark Allocation

**Foundation patterns:**
- More 1-2 mark questions testing individual skills
- Multi-mark questions often scaffolded into parts (a), (b), (c)
- Later parts may depend on earlier parts
- Total marks per question rarely exceed 5-6

**Higher patterns:**
- More 3-5 mark unscaffolded questions
- Single questions requiring method selection
- Marks for efficiency of method (sometimes)
- Extended problems up to 6-8 marks

---

## Part 4: Mark Scheme Construction

### 4.1 Mark Types and Their Meaning

**M marks (Method marks)**
- Awarded for correct mathematical approach
- Can be earned even with arithmetic errors
- Represent "understanding what to do"
- If M1 is not earned, dependent marks cannot be earned

**A marks (Accuracy marks)**
- Awarded for correct execution of method
- Dependent on M marks being earned
- "A1 ft" means follow-through from student's previous (possibly wrong) answer
- Represent "doing it correctly"

**B marks (Independent marks)**
- Awarded for specific correct values/statements
- Not dependent on other marks
- Often used for: final answers, identified values, stated reasons
- Can be earned regardless of method shown

### 4.2 The Dependency System

**Understanding "dep":**
- M1dep means this method mark requires the previous M mark
- Can't earn M1dep if M1 wasn't awarded
- Creates chains of dependent reasoning

**Follow-through (ft) principles:**
- Allows students to earn marks despite earlier errors
- Student must correctly apply method to their wrong value
- ft marks have conditions (e.g., "ft provided their answer > 0")
- Not all questions allow follow-through

### 4.3 Alternative Methods

Strong mark schemes anticipate multiple valid approaches:
- Numerical vs algebraic methods
- Build-up vs unitary methods for ratio
- Different valid orderings of steps
- Geometric vs coordinate methods

Each alternative should have equivalent mark allocation—no method should be advantaged.

### 4.4 Partial Credit Structure

**Scaffold partial credit to reward understanding:**

For a 4-mark calculation:
- M1: Correct setup/approach
- M1dep: Correct intermediate step
- A1: Correct intermediate value
- A1: Correct final answer

This means a student can score 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4—not just all-or-nothing.

### 4.5 Special Case (SC) Marks

SC marks recognise partial understanding in common errors:
- SC1 for correct method with consistent sign error
- SC2 for solving the wrong equation correctly
- SC marks are typically 1-2 less than full marks

Use SC marks for errors that demonstrate understanding despite a systematic mistake.

## Part 5: Question Architecture

### 5.1 Single-Part Question Design

**Structure:** Context → Information → Task → Format requirement

**Example structure (not actual question):**
"[Context establishing scenario]. [Given information]. [Command word + task]. [Answer format instruction]."

**Key principles:**
- Information should appear in natural order
- Don't hide critical information in the middle of text
- Format requirements come last
- Units should be specified if answer requires them

### 5.2 Multi-Part Question Design

**When to use multiple parts:**
- When the problem naturally decomposes into stages
- When earlier results feed into later calculations
- When testing both calculation and interpretation
- When scaffolding helps accessibility (Foundation)

**Scaffolding principles:**
- Part (a) should be achievable independently
- Part (b) may use result from (a) OR introduce new aspect
- "Hence" means students MUST use the previous result
- "Hence or otherwise" allows alternative approaches
- Later parts should not be trivial given earlier parts

**Independence consideration:**
- Sometimes part (b) can be solved without (a)
- This gives able students flexibility
- But scaffolding still helps weaker students

### 5.3 "Show That" Question Architecture

**Purpose:** Test method understanding when answer is known

**Structure:** Setup → Task → Given result

**Design principles:**
- Given result must be non-obvious (can't be guessed)
- Multiple valid approaches should reach the same result
- Working backwards from answer should be detectable
- Marks are for the quality of forward reasoning

**Why use "Show that":**
- Levels the field—all students work toward same target
- Allows multi-mark allocation for single calculation
- Tests understanding rather than arithmetic accuracy
- Enables dependent questions using the proven result

### 5.4 Comparison Question Architecture

**Purpose:** Test ability to use mathematics to make decisions

**Structure:** Scenario → Option A data → Option B data → Question requiring comparison → "You must show your working"

**Design principles:**
- Both options should require calculation
- Raw numbers shouldn't obviously favour one option
- The "better" option should require full calculation to determine
- Correct conclusion without working should not earn full marks

## Part 6: Difficulty Calibration

### 6.1 The Foundation-Higher Spectrum

**Foundation Tier (Grades 1-5):**
- Familiar, well-structured problems
- Numbers chosen for clean arithmetic
- Scaffolded multi-part questions
- Context aids understanding (not an additional barrier)
- Method selection is often implicit in question structure

**Higher Tier (Grades 4-9):**
- Less familiar problem setups
- Algebraic generalisation often required
- Less scaffolding—students choose approach
- Context may require interpretation
- Synthesis of multiple concepts

**Crossover (Grades 4-5):**
- Questions appearing on both tiers
- Accessible to Foundation, but contribute to Higher
- Often at the harder end of Foundation / easier end of Higher

### 6.2 Difficulty Levers

**Numerical complexity:**
- Foundation: Numbers work out to integers or simple fractions
- Higher: Results may be irrational, require surds, or involve harder arithmetic

**Scaffolding level:**
- Foundation: Explicit steps provided
- Higher: Student determines own approach

**Context familiarity:**
- Foundation: Standard contexts (shopping, measurement)
- Higher: May include unfamiliar applications requiring interpretation

**Conceptual demand:**
- Foundation: Single concept application
- Higher: Synthesis of multiple concepts

**Abstraction level:**
- Foundation: Concrete numbers, specific cases
- Higher: Algebraic generalisation, working with variables

**Method selection:**
- Foundation: Method often implied by question structure
- Higher: Multiple valid methods exist; student chooses

### 6.3 Avoiding False Difficulty

**Not valid ways to increase difficulty:**
- Making numbers arbitrarily large
- Using obscure decimal values
- Adding irrelevant information
- Using confusing language
- Including trick elements

**Valid difficulty increases:**
- Requiring more steps of reasoning
- Reducing scaffolding
- Requiring synthesis of concepts
- Asking for generalisation
- Including interpretation of results

## Part 7: Context Integration

### 7.1 When to Use Context

**Use context when:**
- It makes the mathematics more meaningful
- It tests AO3 (problem-solving in context)
- The context naturally gives rise to the mathematics
- Interpreting context is part of the skill being tested

**Use abstract/pure mathematics when:**
- Testing technique fluency (AO1)
- Context would be contrived
- The mathematical structure itself is the focus
- Testing algebraic manipulation skills

### 7.2 Authentic Context Principles

**Contexts should be:**
- Genuinely realistic (plausible scenarios)
- Age-appropriate and culturally inclusive
- Free from specialist knowledge requirements
- Mathematically natural (the maths fits the situation)

**Contexts should NOT be:**
- Contrived to fit desired numbers
- Dependent on real-world knowledge not given
- Culturally specific or exclusionary
- So complex they obscure the mathematics

### 7.3 Information Presentation in Context

**Present information as it would naturally appear:**
- Shopping: Prices, quantities, discounts
- Travel: Distances, times, speeds
- Construction: Measurements, scales
- Statistics: Tables, graphs, summary values

**Don't over-specify:**
- Let context imply some constraints naturally
- Real scenarios don't come with all information pre-processed
- Part of the skill is identifying relevant information

### 7.4 Context Categories and Mathematical Fit

| Context | Natural Mathematics |
|---------|---------------------|
| Money/shopping | Percentages, ratio, four operations |
| Travel/journey | Speed-distance-time, graphs, compound measures |
| Construction/DIY | Area, volume, Pythagoras, scale |
| Recipes/mixing | Ratio, proportion, scaling |
| Sports/games | Probability, statistics, percentages |
| Population/surveys | Statistics, sampling, percentages |
| Science | Formulae, substitution, graphs |

## Part 8: Topic-Specific Construction Principles

### 8.1 Number Questions

**Fraction questions:**
- Test understanding of what fractions represent, not just algorithms
- Mix improper fractions, mixed numbers, and equivalence
- Operations should have mathematical purpose (not arbitrary combination)
- "Simplest form" should require genuine simplification

**Percentage questions:**
- Include forward (find X% of Y) and reverse (Y is X%, find original)
- Compound changes should be logically motivated
- Connect to real contexts where percentages naturally occur
- Test understanding that percentages relate parts to wholes

**Ratio questions:**
- Include sharing AND reasoning about ratios
- Test understanding of ratio as multiplicative relationship
- Include ratios that don't immediately simplify
- Connect to contexts where proportional reasoning is natural

### 8.2 Algebra Questions

**Equation solving:**
- Range from single-step to requiring multiple transformations
- Include equations where x appears on both sides
- Unknowns should represent meaningful quantities in context
- For quadratics, consider whether both solutions are valid in context

**Expression manipulation:**
- Purpose should be clear (simplifying aids further work)
- "Factorise fully" should have multiple stages
- Expansion and simplification should connect logically
- Index laws should appear in realistic algebraic contexts

**Forming equations:**
- Context should naturally give rise to the equation
- The equation formation itself should carry marks
- Solving should not overshadow the formation
- Check that the equation structure is mathematically natural

**Sequences:**
- Include both position-to-term and term-to-term rules
- Test both finding rules AND using them
- Include arithmetic and non-arithmetic sequences (Higher)
- Quadratic sequences should have recognisable second differences

### 8.3 Geometry Questions

**Angle problems:**
- Reasons should be required ("Give reasons for your answer")
- Acceptable reasons are specific named properties
- Diagrams should be labelled to enable clear reasoning
- Multiple steps should require chaining of angle facts

**Area and volume:**
- Compound shapes should decompose logically
- Include units and unit conversion where appropriate
- Formulae may need to be recalled (check formula sheet provisions)
- Context should determine what "makes sense" for the answer

**Pythagoras and trigonometry:**
- Diagrams essential; clearly labelled
- Right angle must be evident or stated
- "Not drawn accurately" is standard
- Include 3D problems requiring identification of triangles (Higher)

**Transformations:**
- Full description means: transformation type + all required parameters
- Reflection: type + mirror line equation
- Rotation: type + centre + angle + direction
- Enlargement: type + scale factor + centre
- Translation: type + vector (column form)

### 8.4 Statistics Questions

**Averages from data:**
- Include raw data AND frequency tables
- Grouped data requires "estimate" of mean
- Modal class (not mode) for grouped data
- Median from cumulative frequency requires interpolation justification

**Data representation:**
- Reading and interpreting should accompany drawing
- Cumulative frequency graphs → box plots is common progression
- Histograms must use frequency density (Higher)
- Sampling questions should address representativeness

**Comparison questions:**
- Require specific statistical values in comparison
- "Make two comparisons" means two distinct statistical observations
- Comparisons should reference specific values (not just "higher/lower")
- Should reference both average (central tendency) and spread

### 8.5 Probability Questions

**Basic probability:**
- Single event probabilities as entry point
- Fractions, decimals, percentages should all be acceptable (unless specified)
- Complement rule should be applicable
- Sample spaces should be systematic

**Combined events:**
- Tree diagrams for sequential events
- Sample space diagrams for simultaneous events
- With/without replacement distinction
- "And" vs "Or" scenarios

**Conditional probability (Higher):**
- Venn diagrams as primary representation
- Given constraints change the sample space
- Clear distinction between P(A and B) and P(A given B)
- Context should make the conditioning natural

---

## Part 9: Answer Format Requirements

### 9.1 When to Specify Format

**Always specify format when:**
- Multiple valid forms exist (decimal vs fraction vs percentage)
- Specific precision is expected (decimal places, significant figures)
- Mathematical convention requires particular form (standard form, surd)
- The format itself tests understanding

**Format instructions:**
- "Give your answer as a fraction" – must be fraction
- "Give your answer in its simplest form" – full simplification required
- "Give your answer to 2 decimal places" – round appropriately
- "Give your answer in standard form" – A × 10^n where 1 ≤ A < 10
- "Give your answer in the form a√b" – surd form required

### 9.2 Unit Requirements

**Specify units when:**
- Multiple unit systems are possible
- Unit conversion is part of the skill being tested
- Units are crucial to the context

**Phrasing:**
- "State the units of your answer" – student must write units
- Answer space showing units means they're already provided
- Context may imply units without explicit statement

### 9.3 Accuracy Requirements

**Decimal places vs significant figures:**
- Decimal places for financial and measurement contexts
- Significant figures for scientific contexts
- Default expectation varies by question type

**Standard expectation:**
- Money: 2 decimal places (pounds and pence)
- Measurements: Appropriate to precision of given data
- Trigonometry/surds: Often exact form or 3 significant figures

## Part 10: Quality Assurance Principles

### 10.1 Before Finalising a Question

**Check for:**
- [ ] Clear, unambiguous wording
- [ ] Appropriate command word for intended task
- [ ] Mark allocation justified by cognitive demand
- [ ] All information needed is provided
- [ ] No extraneous information (unless intentional)
- [ ] Answer format specified where necessary
- [ ] Diagrams labelled and marked "Not drawn accurately"
- [ ] Context is realistic and inclusive
- [ ] Numbers chosen to work appropriately for tier

### 10.2 Mark Scheme Verification

**Check for:**
- [ ] Marks sum to stated total
- [ ] Each mark has clear earning criteria
- [ ] Alternative methods are equivalent in mark allocation
- [ ] Partial credit is available (not all-or-nothing)
- [ ] Follow-through instructions are clear
- [ ] Common errors considered for SC marks where appropriate

### 10.3 Tier Appropriateness

**Foundation check:**
- Is this achievable by a Grade 3 student with effort?
- Does scaffolding guide without giving away method?
- Are numbers conducive to arithmetic by hand?

**Higher check:**
- Does this discriminate among Grades 6-9?
- Is there scope for elegant/efficient solutions?
- Does it require genuine synthesis or reasoning?

---

## Part 11: Generating Original Questions

### 11.1 The Generation Process

1. **Select topic and subtopic** – Be specific (not just "algebra" but "solving linear equations where unknown appears on both sides")

2. **Determine target difficulty** – Foundation/Higher and approximate grade band

3. **Choose assessment objective balance** – Will this test technique (AO1), reasoning (AO2), or problem-solving (AO3)?

4. **Design structure** – Single part? Multi-part? Show that? Comparison?

5. **Create mathematical core** – What calculation/reasoning is required?

6. **Develop context** (if applicable) – Does context add meaning or just words?

7. **Choose numbers** – Do they work for the tier? Do they avoid false difficulty?

8. **Write question text** – Clear, natural progression of information

9. **Determine mark allocation** – Based on cognitive demand, not just steps

10. **Construct mark scheme** – M/A/B marks with alternatives

11. **Verify** – Use Part 10 checklists

### 11.2 Avoiding Regurgitation

**Original questions come from:**
- Starting with mathematical structure, then finding fresh context
- Combining concepts in new configurations
- Varying the "question type" for familiar content
- Changing the direction of reasoning (given A find B → given B find A)

**Questions feel copied when:**
- Context and numbers are changed but structure is identical
- Phrasing exactly mirrors known questions
- Mark allocation doesn't match the actual question's demands
- The question could be memorised and reproduced

### 11.3 Creating Authentic Variation

**For a topic like "percentages":**

Don't just vary numbers. Vary:
- Forward vs reverse percentage
- Single vs compound percentage change
- Given percentage vs find the percentage
- Percentage as comparison vs percentage as operation
- Pure calculation vs contextual problem-solving
- Finding the percentage vs finding the original amount vs finding the result
- Multiple percentage changes (repeated same vs different rates)

Each of these requires genuinely different mathematical thinking, even though all involve "percentages."

### 11.4 The Novelty Test

Ask: "Could a student who has memorised past papers answer this using recognition rather than understanding?"

If yes, the question is not original enough. Original questions require:
- Fresh application of known techniques
- Novel combination of familiar elements
- Reasoning that cannot be pattern-matched
- Context that must be genuinely interpreted

## Part 12: Worked Example of Principle Application

This section demonstrates applying these principles to construct a question, showing the thinking process without providing a template to copy.

### 12.1 Design Brief

**Target:** Higher Tier, Grade 6-7
**Topic:** Compound measures (speed, density, pressure)
**Assessment objective:** AO3 (problem-solving in context)
**Marks:** 4

### 12.2 Principle Application

**Step 1: Mathematical core**
What compound measure reasoning could be tested? Options:
- Speed-distance-time calculation
- Density-mass-volume relationship
- Combining different compound measures

Choice: Two-stage journey with different speeds, requiring time calculation and comparison.

**Step 2: Context development**
What scenarios involve journeys with varying speeds?
- Commuting (train delays, traffic)
- Delivery services (different road types)
- Sports (varying pace)

Choice: Delivery scenario—feels authentic, naturally involves time constraints.

**Step 3: Structure decision**
This requires: finding two times, adding them, comparing to deadline.
That's 3-4 distinct steps = appropriate for 4 marks.
No scaffolding—student must determine approach.

**Step 4: Number selection**
For Higher, numbers don't need to be "clean" but should be realistic.
- Distances: Two-digit numbers in reasonable range for deliveries (20-100 km)
- Speeds: Realistic for context (motorway vs urban: 60-80 km/h vs 20-40 km/h)
- Time constraint: Should make answer non-obvious

**Step 5: Information presentation**
Present: departure time, two distances, two speeds, deadline.
Don't present: total distance (student combines), total time (student calculates).

**Step 6: Mark scheme construction**
- M1: Calculating first time segment
- M1: Calculating second time segment
- M1dep: Finding total time or arrival time
- A1: Correct conclusion with supporting values

**Step 7: Verification**
- Cognitive demand matches 4 marks? Yes—requires extraction, multiple calculations, comparison.
- Could be solved by recognition? No—numbers and setup are fresh.
- Tier appropriate? Yes—compound calculation without scaffolding is Grade 6+ expectation.

## Summary: The Essence of AQA Style

An AQA question succeeds when it:

1. **Tests understanding, not recall** – Students must think, not remember
2. **Provides accessible entry points** – All students can make progress
3. **Discriminates effectively** – Better understanding yields better marks
4. **Uses authentic mathematics** – The maths fits the context naturally
5. **Allocates marks fairly** – Marks reflect cognitive demand
6. **Enables partial credit** – Understanding is rewarded even with errors
7. **Communicates clearly** – No ambiguity in what's being asked
8. **Respects students** – No tricks, no artificial difficulty

Master these principles, and every generated question will be genuinely original while maintaining authentic AQA character.
