## CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Combined Science - **5,400/mo** (URGENT)

This is a MASSIVE gap. Combined Science is a single GCSE that combines Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Very popular as many students take this instead of triple science.

| Keyword | Volume |
|---------|--------|
| aqa combined science past papers | 5,400 |
| combined science aqa past papers | 2,400 |
| edexcel combined science past papers | 1,600 |
| gcse aqa combined science past papers | 1,600 |

**Action:** Add "Combined Science" as a subject with all three exam boards.

### 2. English Language vs English Literature

These are TWO DIFFERENT SUBJECTS with separate high volume:

| Keyword | Volume |
|---------|--------|
| aqa english literature past papers | 4,400 |
| aqa english language past papers | 3,600 |
| gcse english language past papers | 2,900 |
| aqa gcse english language past papers | 2,400 |
| aqa english language paper 1 past papers | 1,900 |

**Action:** Ensure both English Language AND English Literature exist as separate subjects.

### 3. Foundation Tier Papers - **1,900/mo**

Students specifically search for Foundation (easier) vs Higher tier papers:

| Keyword | Volume |
|---------|--------|
| aqa gcse foundation maths past papers | 1,900 |
| aqa foundation maths past papers | 1,900 |
| edexcel foundation maths past papers | 1,600 |

**Action:** Consider adding Foundation/Higher filter or separate pages.

### 4. iGCSE (International GCSE) - **1,900/mo**

International students searching for Edexcel iGCSE:

| Keyword | Volume |
|---------|--------|
| edexcel igcse maths past papers | 1,900 |
| igcse past papers chemistry edexcel | 1,000 |
| edexcel igcse biology past papers | 880 |

**Action:** Consider adding iGCSE as a separate qualification level.

### 5. AS Level (Year 12) - **2,900/mo**

AS Level is different from full A-Level (Year 12 only):

| Keyword | Volume |
|---------|--------|
| aqa past papers as level psychology | 2,900 |
| as level maths edexcel past papers | 1,300 |
| aqa as level chemistry past papers | 1,000 |

**Action:** Consider AS Level as separate from A-Level, or add AS/A2 paper filters.

### 6. Specific Paper Numbers - **1,900/mo**

Students search for specific papers (Paper 1, Paper 2, Paper 3):

| Keyword | Volume |
|---------|--------|
| aqa english language paper 1 past papers | 1,900 |
| aqa english language paper 2 past papers | 1,300 |

**Action:** Consider adding paper number filters or metadata.
